                Traffic Sign Classification System uses advanced deep learning
                algorithms to improve road safety and driver awareness. The
                system uses camera as  real-time input device, capturing live
                video feeds and processing each frame to identify and classify
                traffic signs on the fly. Built with strong technologies like
                TensorFlow and Keras, system uses Convolutional Neural
                Networks (CNNs) to reliably interpret traffic signals such as
                speed restrictions, stop signs, and warnings.

                Traffic Sign Classification is designed to classify
                traffic signs accurately from static images. By harnessing
                power of deep learning technologies like TensorFlow and Keras,
                the system processes uploaded images to identify and categorize
                traffic signs such as speed limits, stop signs, and directional
                indicators. Using (CNNs), model ensures high precision and reliability, making it an
                essential tool for educational, road safety research,
                and transportation system advancements.
